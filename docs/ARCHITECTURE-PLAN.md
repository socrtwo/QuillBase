# Architecture plan

> **This is a plan, not a description of existing code.** Anne's Base has no code yet. The design mirrors what the sister apps already ship (Anne's Pen, Anne's Grid, Anne's Stage, Anne's Folio), so that the suite shares one shell and one set of conventions. Details will change as the code is written; this file will then be replaced by `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Summary

Anne's Base will be a TypeScript web application built with **Vite** and tested with **vitest**. The Android and iOS releases will package it with **Capacitor 8**, the Windows, macOS and Linux releases with **Electron**, and the same build will run in a browser as an installable, offline-capable **PWA**. It shares the suite shell: command registry, ribbon, Quick Access Bar, customizable tabs and keyboard, command search, macro recorder, AI setup and providers, the recovery engine's generic parts, and the platform layer. It also shares the **classic menu bar** with Anne's Loom and Anne's Lens.

New to the suite are a **storage engine** (SQLite compiled to WebAssembly, with a journal), a **query engine** layer (dialects, the query grid, plans), **designers** for tables, queries, forms, reports and macros, **format readers** for Access, xBase, Paradox and the rest, and **connectors** to servers.

## Key design decisions

- **SQLite as the native engine.** It is public domain, extremely well tested, runs everywhere including the browser (WASM on OPFS), and its file format is documented and stable — so a `.qbase` file is never a hostage to this app. Access/Jet semantics (Jet SQL, domain functions, crosstabs, wildcards, date literals) are provided by a translation layer, not by emulating Jet.
- **Live Access files, carefully.** `.accdb`/`.mdb` files open in place through the `formats/jet` reader-writer; until a feature's round-trip tests against Access pass, writes go through *Convert* to `.qbase` with a link back, and the user is told.
- **The journal is part of the engine.** Every write path (datasheet, forms, action queries, code, imports) goes through one transaction layer that records before and after images, so undo, history, as-of views, restore and lineage are reliable rather than per-feature.
- **One layout engine for forms and reports,** with layout groups (stacked, tabular) as in Access, absolute positioning for imported legacy designs, and reflow for phone widths.
- **Designs as data.** Objects are stored as versioned JSON in `qb_` tables, which gives object history, text export, diff and recovery for free.
- **Large data.** The datasheet virtualizes rows and columns; imports stream; analytical work on large Parquet/CSV files can use DuckDB-WASM (MIT) as an optional module.
- **Multi-user.** On desktop, `.qbase` files on a shared folder use SQLite's locking with WAL, which suits a handful of simultaneous users on a reliable network share, as Access does; for more, *Move to Server* (`dbtools.moveToServer`) upsizes to PostgreSQL or MySQL or the suite relay. The app says so rather than letting a share corrupt a file.

## Classic menus

As in Anne's Loom and Anne's Lens: menu layouts are generated at build time from `docs/commands-plan.json` (the data behind [MENUS-PLAN.md](MENUS-PLAN.md)); every entry is a command id, so the catalog test guarantees that no layout names a missing command.

## Platform specifics

- **Android:** *Open with* and *Share to* for `.qbase`, `.accdb`, `.mdb`, `.dbf`, `.sqlite`, `.db`, `.csv`; Storage Access Framework for files; barcode scanning with the camera (`form.scanner`).
- **iOS/iPadOS:** document-based app with Files integration.
- **Windows/macOS/Linux (Electron):** native ODBC and server drivers, the local REST API, command-line switches, file association, printing through the system dialogs.
- **Web (PWA):** OPFS storage, File System Access API where available (download/upload otherwise), server connections through the relay.

## Builds and CI

The sister apps' workflows: type check, unit tests, catalog test, corpus tests (recovery and format round trips), then builds for every platform on tags.

## Performance and correctness tests

Datasheet scrolling at 1 million rows; import of a 1 GB CSV; Jet SQL compatibility suite (the queries of the classic Access sample databases); round trips `.accdb → .qbase → .accdb`; recovery scores on the damaged corpus; interpreter conformance suites.
